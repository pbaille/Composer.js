Dev notes

-Timeline object should be unique and in the AC namespace, so each other object can access it without a property that reference it
-Bar(s) can be appended to it via #append method or simply by push them to timeline.grid attribute
-it can be configured via #config method or directly by attribute assign
-all bar's directives should be wrapped in a timeline attribute array called "directives" sort by position, in order that the timer can apply directives to repected generators in time without to check every single directive position, once a directive is applied it is send to the last index of the array
